- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlashDragons. I'm from China.
-   Just like my avatar, I really like Minecraft, which is also my biggest motivation for learning Java.
-   Minecraft Java Edition ID: Flash_ Dragons, Xbox ID: FlashDragons. Perhaps one day you will encounter me on a certain server.
- 👀 I’m interested in Java. Now I'm learning Java, and my goal is to be able to write mods in Minecraft.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pharmacy, which is my professional course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on modules writing. Of course, I don't know Java yet.
- 📫 I don't have my own personal website, but I provided some of my commonly used social accounts.
