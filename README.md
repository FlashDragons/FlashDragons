- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlashDragons. I'm from China, you can call me '闪火龙' in Chinese. 
-   On most social software websites, my ID is '世界重构'.
-   Just like my avatar, I really like Minecraft, which is also my biggest motivation for learning Java.
-   Java Edition ID: Flash_ Dragons, Bedrock Edition ID: FlashDragons. Perhaps one day you will encounter me on a certain server.
- 👀 I’m interested in Java and Python. Currently, computer classes in school are teaching Python, so I plan to learn Java later.
-   My goal is to be able to write modules in Minecraft.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pharmacy, which is my professional course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on modules writing. Of course, I don't know Java yet.
- 📫 I don't have my own personal website, but I provided some of my commonly used social accounts.
